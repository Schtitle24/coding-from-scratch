Howdy! 

Welcome to my portfolio project! This allows me to house my projects and work in a single location that is visible to the public. 
Through this page you will be able to view my work, read a little bit about me, and contact me with questions, inqueries, or job offers. 

This project serves as an example of the coding I am capable of, as well as allowing potential employers to easily view the rest of my portfolio. 
It acts as a hub for my contact information making it easy to contact me. 
It acts as an introduction, hopefully leaving the viewer with more information about me than they had when they first visited the page.

If you wish to contribute to my work you can find my repository linked at the bottom of the README.
